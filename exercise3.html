        <h3><span class="headline">Intro</span></h3>
        <p>Somebody once told me<br>
            The world is gonna roll me<br>
            I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed<br>
            She was looking kind of dumb<br>
            With her finger and her thumb<br>
            In the shape of an <span class="talking">"L"</span> on her forehead</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pre-chorus">
        <h3><span class="headline">Pre-Chorus</span></h3>
        <p>Well, the years start coming<br>
            And they don't stop coming<br>
            Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
            Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
            Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb<br>
            So much to do, so much to see<br>
            So what's wrong with taking the back streets?<br>
            You'll never know if you don't go<br>
            You'll never shine if you don't glow</p>

    <div class="chorus">
        <h3><span class="headline">Chorus</span></h3>
        <p>Hey now, you're an all star<br>
            Get your game on, go play<br>
            Hey now, you're a rock star<br>
            Get the show on, get paid<br>
            And all that glitters is gold<br>
            Only shooting stars break the mold</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <h3><span class="headline">Verse 2</span></h3>
        <p>It's a cool place and they say it gets colder<br>
            You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older<br>
            But the meteor men beg to differ<br>
            Judging by the hole in the satellite picture<br>
            The ice we skate is getting pretty thin<br>
            The water's getting warm so you might as well swim<br>
            My world's on fire, how about yours?<br>
            That's the way I like it and I never get bored</p>

                I need to get myself away from this place"</span><br>
            I said, <span class="talking">"Yep, what a concept<br>
                I could use a little fuel myself"</span><br>
            And we could all use a little change
