        <h1>The <b>Lord</b> Of The <b>Rings</b></h1>
        <h3><i>The Fellowship Of The Ring</i></h3>
        <p>The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel by the English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien.<br>
            Set in Middle-earth, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit, but
            eventually developed into a much larger work.<br>
            Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever
            written, with over 150 million copies sold.</p>

        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>Bilbo celebrates his eleventy-first (111th) birthday and leaves the Shire suddenly, passing the Ring to Frodo
            Baggins, his cousin[e] and heir. Neither hobbit is aware of the Ring's origin, but the wizard Gandalf
            suspects it is a Ring of Power. Seventeen years later, in "The Shadow of the Past", Gandalf confirms to
            Frodo that the Ring is the one lost by the Dark Lord Sauron long ago and counsels Frodo to take it away from
            the Shire. Gandalf leaves, promising to return by Frodo's birthday and accompany Frodo on his journey, but
            fails to do so.</p>
        <h2>Concept & Creation</h2>
        <p>Although a major work in itself, The Lord of the Rings was only the last movement of a much older set of
            narratives Tolkien had worked on since 1917 encompassing <strong>The Silmarillion</strong>, in a process he
            described as mythopoeia.</p>
        <h2>Publication history</h2>
        <p>A dispute with his publisher, George Allen & Unwin, led Tolkien to offer the work to William Collins in 1950.
            Tolkien intended The Silmarillion (itself largely unrevised at this point) to be published along with The
            Lord of the Rings, but Allen & Unwin were unwilling to do this. After Milton Waldman, his contact at
            Collins, expressed the belief that The Lord of the Rings itself <i>"urgently wanted cutting"</i>, Tolkien
            eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952. Collins did not; and so Tolkien wrote to Allen and
            Unwin, saying, <i>"I would gladly consider the publication of any part of the stuff"</i>, fearing his work
            would never see the light of day.</p>
